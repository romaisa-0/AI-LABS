This project focuses on implementing a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve optimization problems and visualizing its progress using a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. The program optimizes the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 \) by simulating evolution through selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism. Users input parameters like population size, number of generations, mutation rate, and bounds through the GUI, and the algorithm finds the best solution while displaying results and evolution progress. The project demonstrates the working of GAs and provides a user-friendly tool for solving optimization problems efficiently.
